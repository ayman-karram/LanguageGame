# LanguageGame
The player will see a word in language „one“ on the screen. While this word is displayed, a word in language „two“ will fall down on the screen. The player will have to choose if the falling word is the correct translation or a wrong translation. The player needs to answer, before the word reaches the bottom of the screen. A counter that gives the player feedback is included.
